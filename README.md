# Capstone

Repository for my capstone project: 
## Differentiating LLM and Student Authorship in Long-Form Text

Classification models to distinguish AI-Generated text from student-written essays. 

Feature extraction pipeline:
* Longformer Embeddings
* Bigram and Trigram Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
* Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC-22) 

Full repository is still being curated from local Jupyter Notebooks, demo.ipynb included for example implementation.
